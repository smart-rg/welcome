New to SMART? Welcome!

SMART (Stopping Malware and Researching Threats) is a proposed Research Group in the IRTF (Internet Research Task Force) that aims to research methods to efficiently and effectively detect, mitigate, prevent or eliminate threats; to guide protocol development in the IETF; to become the authority on attack detection and prevention in the IRTF/IETF.

Every work item in this group will fall in one of four categories:
1. Research on attacks or defences enabled or disabled by IETF protocols, and recommending protocol design fixes or considerations as a result â€“ including privacy considerations
2. Papers on principles/key concepts in attack defence, to underpin attack defence research of protocols and evidence a threat landscape
3. Creating methodologies for researchers to consistently analyse protocols for attack defence, and use these to perform such analysis
4. Scoping out specific security research problems outside of the above three points. The sole aim of these scoping exercises is to create an Internet Draft and establish feasibility of creating a separate IRTF security research group on that specific security problem.

The IRTF is in a unique position to do research and establish robust evidence on these topics. This group aims to research the effect of protocol changes on attacks, defences and the threat landscape. Once the existing landscape is established, we aim to stimulate methodical research into attack defence methods and assessments for new protocols. Protocols are already rigorously assessed for certain security properties, yet researching how protocols relate to attacks and defences is a valuable but under-researched field. This group would begin that work.
